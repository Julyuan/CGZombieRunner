The project is a homework in course Computer Graphics
You can build the two executable programs using CMake
REMEMBER that if you want to see the effects of DreamCar
You need to install Assimp and adjust the CURDIR to this directory using absolute path
CURDIR is defined in DreamCar.cpp
And I hope you can run this program on Mac
If you want to run it on Windows please adjust #include <GLUT/glut.h> accordingly
